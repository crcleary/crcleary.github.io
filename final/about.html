<h2> About Me</h2>
<p1> I am a rising senior at Massachussettes College of Art and Design, and I am incredibly passionate about Publication Design. I have been obsessed with books and reading since I was small. As I grew older it became more than just about the story inside, but the structure of the pages, layouts, and covers. Thats when I knew Graphic Design was the career for me.</p1>
